This project demonstrates the complete workflow for a Computer Vision model: from training and evaluation to making the final model portable and ready for high-speed inference.
## Core Project Focus
High-Speed Implementation: Utilized the efficient YOLOv5 architecture.
Performance Evaluation: Tracked key metrics like mAP (Mean Average Precision) during the training cycle.
MLOps & Deployment Readiness: Focus on ensuring the trained model can be seamlessly integrated into various production environments.
## Technical Pipeline
Model Architecture: Used a pre-trained YOLOv5 model with Transfer Learning (implied).

Deployment Conversion: Successfully converted the final trained model into the ONNX format. This standardized format allows the model to be run efficiently across different hardware and inference engines (like ONNX Runtime).
## Technologies Used
Python | YOLOv5 / Ultralytics | ONNX | PyTorch (Implied for framework)
